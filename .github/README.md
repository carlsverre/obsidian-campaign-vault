<h1 align="center">Obsidian Campaign Vault</h1>

---

A generic [Obsidian] vault template to help game masters run well organized games in a shared sandbox. Can be used with any system from the most common (D&D) to the most esoteric (everyone is John).

## Getting Started

Checkout this repository from GitHub using [GitHub Desktop] or the command line:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/carlsverre/obsidian-campaign-vault.git
```

Then just open it up in Obsidian and start exploring.

## The Layout

### How It Works  

This layout is inspired by the [Johnny Decimal system].
- Folders marked with **■** are **headers**.
- Header folders don’t contain notes themselves — they just group related subfolders.
  - With the exception of `00 ■ System` to hide concepts like Templates and Attachments.
- This keeps everything flat and one-dimensional, so you always know where things belong.

### Outline  

- **00 ■ System** → Templates and supporting files
- **01 Inbox** → Quick-capture notes and ideas
- **02 Rules** → Core rules and house rules 
- **20 ■ Campaign** → Big-picture campaign notes
- **21 Codex** → Campaign details, handouts, & guides
- **22 Webs** → Relationship and connection maps
- **23 Fronts** → Threats, countdowns, and pressures
- **24 Sessions** → Session logs and recaps 
- **30 ■ Setting** → World foundations and themes 
- **31 Locations** → Cities, dungeons, regions
- **32 Factions** → Groups with power and agendas 
- **33 Culture** → Traditions, languages, beliefs 
- **34 Species** → Creatures and kinds of beings
- **35 Persona** → Archetypes and common roles
- **36 Maps** → Visual references and cartography 
- **40 ■ Entities** → The cast of the world 
- **41 Characters** → Player characters 
- **42 NPCs** → Non-player characters
